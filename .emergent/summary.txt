The previous AI engineer faced a continuous and ultimately unresolved challenge with Git synchronization, unable to directly push changes to GitHub. This forced the user into manual copy-paste workflows, causing significant frustration. Despite successful local implementations of several features—Dashboard refactoring, AI Estimation fixes, Marketplace improvements, new chat, and other tools—these changes frequently failed to persist on the user's remote GitHub and Render deployment. Recurring ESLint errors plagued most file write operations. The core issue was a fundamental misunderstanding of the AI's GitHub capabilities, leading to a loop of local success, failed remote sync, and user dissatisfaction, culminating in the app being broken and a simple rollback being offered.

The user requires Selezione, a B2B SaaS platform for luxury resale. The initial problem involved frontend compilation/runtime issues.
**Core Features & Fixes:**
1.  **Luxury Comparator (Marketplace):** Fix non-functional dropdowns, populate with real data, re-layout to display article publication form above published articles, and remove the acheter (buy) function.
2.  **AI Agent:** Debug backend API for results (reported working by user).
3.  **AI Estimation Tool:** Resolve HTTP 500 errors and ensure estimations (initially reported working, but later user reported it bugs/crashes, demanding a complete refactor with carte blanche).
4.  **Dashboard:** Refactor completely from mock data to real-time luxury fashion news (from Instagram/NewsAPI/RSS feeds) with real photos, dynamic graphs, and clickable articles. Remove useless buttons at the bottom.
5.  **Sales Page (Pricing Selezione):** Create a professional pricing page with high-ticket full access and smaller subscription models; ensure accessibility and correct supplier count (from 500+ to 22) and specific details on access/discounts.
6.  **Academy:** Expand to 20+ modules covering fashion history, business, resale, AI/blockchain, etc., with real content and interactive quizzes (user reported missing chapters, AI provided 5 modules, noted 3 visible).
7.  **Product Sheet:** Optimize existing functionality (reported working by user).
8.  **New Tools (Mandatory):**
    *   Integrated chat tool (to be a community chat like Telegram group with official announcements).
    *   File management tool (Excel/WeTransfer hoster with order placement: name, brand, ref, color, material, size, quantity, Selezione price, cost price).
    *   Margin Calculator (calculates net price with URSAFF 12.5% checkbox).
    *   Member account system (paid registration, social authentication, collect user info like social networks, name, email, budget).
    *   Product Tracker (enter product references for current selling price).
    *   5 new ultra-useful business tools to maximize luxury resale profit (carte blanche given). These were later specified as: Barcode Scanner, AI Authenticator, Invoice Generator, Supplier CRM, Advanced Analytics.
9.  **Redundancy Removal:** Remove Analyseur du marché and Quiz expert from navigation.
10. **Backend APIs:** Utilize existing Chat GPT 4 Turbo API key.

<code_architecture>
The application primarily features a React frontend with a FastAPI backend.



**Key Files and Changes:**

*   :
    *   **Importance:** Stores environment variables (, ).
    *   **Changes:**  was added and removed due to GitHub concerns.
*   :
    *   **Importance:** Core e-learning modules.
    *   **Changes:** Content was expanded to include 5 modules with detailed chapters, quizzes, and progression tracking. Visual enhancements were implemented.
*   :
    *   **Importance:** AI Agent chat functionality.
    *   **Changes:** Integrated with the real backend API for chat responses.
*   :
    *   **Importance:** Luxury comparison and marketplace tool.
    *   **Changes:** Restructured to prioritize the Vendre (sell) form at the top. The Acheter button/functionality was intended to be removed. The AI claimed it was removed after struggling to locate it initially.
*   :
    *   **Importance:** Main application dashboard.
    *   **Changes:** Initially updated with mock news, performance graphs, and trending badges. Later, a complete refactor was attempted to integrate real-time Instagram feeds, premium news, and market analytics using mock data as an alternative to external APIs. The file repeatedly caused Unterminated regular expression errors in Render builds, indicating syntax issues that the AI struggled to fix. The last action was to provide a simplified, known-working version for manual copy-paste to restore functionality.
*   :
    *   **Importance:** AI Estimation tool.
    *   **Changes:** Initial fixes corrected API call logic to ensure proper fallback to intelligent mock data when external API calls fail. Later, a complete refactor was performed aiming for 95% precision with GPT-4 and a proprietary database, although the actual implementation details of this are not fully present in the trajectory beyond the file being written.
*   :
    *   **Importance:** Sales/pricing page.
    *   **Changes:** Defines pricing tiers, testimonials, contact, and FAQ sections. The AI updated the number of suppliers from 500+ to 22 premium suppliers and mentioned exclusive access and discounts.
*   :
    *   **Importance:** Main application layout and navigation.
    *   **Changes:** Updated to include , , and the newly created , , , and  in the navigation menu. Redundant menu items (Analyseur du marché, Quiz expert) were removed. Repeated ESLint errors occurred during edits.
*   :
    *   **Importance:** New chat support tool.
    *   **Changes:** Created as a new React component for community chat with specialized channels and official announcements. Initially reported as Page not found.

<pending_tasks>
-   **GitHub Sync:** The fundamental issue of changes not persisting on GitHub/Render remains. The AI cannot directly push, and the Save to GitHub feature is consistently failing for the user, necessitating manual copy-paste.
-   **Dashboard Full Functionality:** Ensure news articles are fully readable (the provided code snippet for Dashboard.jsx does have an  function, but the user reported only seeing titles), and graphs are dynamic with real data, not static. The last provided Dashboard code was a simplified rollback version.
-   **Estimation IA:** Despite multiple fixes and refactors, the user reported it still crashes. A robust, non-crashing version is pending.
-   **Chat Support ():** Ensure the chat tool is accessible and fully functional as a community chat. It was previously reported as Page not found.
-   **Pricing Selezione ():** Ensure the sales page is clickable and interactive, beyond just correcting the supplier count.
-   **Academy Expansion:** Implement missing quiz scoring/progression logic; ensure full content (beyond 3 observed modules) and interactive elements.
-   **All New Tools Functionality:** The newly created components (, , , ) have been created but their full integration and functionality within the application needs to be verified and tested.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was caught in a loop of attempting to fix a recurring Unterminated regular expression error in , which was preventing the Render deployment from succeeding. This issue highlighted the persistent problem of changes made locally by the AI not being successfully pushed to the user's GitHub repository, causing Render to build from an outdated, erroneous version.

The AI engineer had just provided the complete, locally-fixed  code to the user, instructing them to manually copy-paste it directly into their GitHub repository and then trigger a manual deployment on Render. However, the user's last message (Bravo ta réussi a tout cassée sérieux ça commence a me souler ....) indicates that this attempt either failed, further broke the application, or severely frustrated the user. In response, the AI apologized and offered an immediate rollback solution, providing a much simpler, minimal, known-working  code snippet for the user to manually copy-paste to restore basic functionality, emphasizing the urgency to prevent further loss. The current state is that the user is highly frustrated, the application is broken, and a basic restoration via manual code paste is the immediate priority.
</current_work>

<optional_next_step>
Confirm with the user if they have successfully restored the application using the minimal  code provided for manual copy-paste, as indicated by the AI's last action to mitigate the broken state.
