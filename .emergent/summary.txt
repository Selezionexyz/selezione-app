The AI engineer's trajectory involved systematically addressing user feedback for the Selezione SaaS platform, shifting from initial bug fixes to comprehensive feature enhancements. Key challenges included persistent ESLint errors, a recurring login/redirection issue preventing dashboard access post-authentication, and the need to replace all fictional data with real-time API integrations. The engineer successfully implemented a user registration/trial system, transformed the dashboard and trend tracking to use real data, converted a fictional barcode scanner to a product reference scanner, enhanced file management with a complete shopping cart, and restricted CRM access. Additionally, six new professional tools were developed. The work is structured in phases, with the engineer concluding by integrating a new welcome animation into the main application, despite the persistent frontend access issue.

The user requires Selezione, a B2B SaaS platform for luxury resale, aiming to fix existing issues and enhance functionality with real-time, accurate data. Initial goals included debugging the Luxury Comparator, AI Agent, and AI Estimation tools, refactoring the Dashboard for real-time news and dynamic graphs, creating a professional Sales Page, expanding the Academy, and integrating new mandatory tools like a community chat, file management, margin calculator, member account system, and five ultra-useful business tools (Barcode Scanner, AI Authenticator, Invoice Generator, Supplier CRM, Advanced Analytics). Subsequent refinements emphasized replacing all fictional data (Instagram, news, market figures, scanner) with real-time, professional API data, making news articles clickable, enabling file consultation and a purchase order system, reorganizing the menu, improving dashboard utility, and implementing a new user registration with free trial and access limitations.

The application features a React frontend and a FastAPI backend, structured as follows:



**Key Files and Changes:**
-   : Main entry point. Modified to conditionally render  or  based on authentication, and is currently being updated to integrate .
-   : Created for user registration/login and trial system. Handles authentication state via local storage. Was debugged for display/logic issues.
-   : Created to show trial account limitations and prompt upgrades.
-   : Main layout and navigation. Updated to integrate authentication flow, manage user state, handle logout, and dynamically render content based on . Crucially, its menu structure and  object were extensively updated to include all newly created tools.
-   : Transformed from a fake dashboard to a Dashboard Intelligence Luxe ( was created and replaced it). It now displays real product trends, market data, and news from luxury-focused sources (Vogue, WWD).
-   : Marketplace component. Fixed issues with published photos not displaying, specifically by correcting image source paths ().
-   : Transformed from a fictional barcode scanner to a Scanner Référence Produit Professionnel ( was created and replaced it).

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was in PHASE 3: NETTOYAGE FINAL and PHASE 4: ANIMATION DACCUEIL". Phase 3 involved general optimization and integration of all newly developed tools into the main application layout. This specifically included updating `SaasLayout.jsx` to restructure its menu and `views` object to properly incorporate and display components for all 12 corrected features and 6 new professional tools. Following this, the engineer moved to "PHASE 4: ANIMATION DACCUEIL, which involved creating a new React component, , for a professional welcome animation. The very last action recorded in the trajectory was the initiation of integrating this  component into the primary  file to serve as the application's entry animation. A persistent challenge throughout the work has been a frontend login/redirection issue, where the application often reverts to the authentication page despite successful login attempts by automated tests or code changes. This issue remained unresolved at the end of the trajectory.
