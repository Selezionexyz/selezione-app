The previous AI engineer's work trajectory was characterized by an iterative problem-solving approach, marked by persistent technical challenges and fluctuating user satisfaction. Initially, the core issue revolved around Git synchronization failures, forcing manual user intervention for deployments and leading to significant frustration regarding broken application states and recurring ESLint errors. The engineer successfully addressed multiple UI/UX and functionality bugs, particularly in , , and , and also implemented several new tools and features. A critical turning point was the realization that the backend on Render was an Express.js app while the local code was FastAPI, causing API mismatches. The AI proactively shifted to using the local FastAPI. The trajectory concludes with the AI successfully implementing a new user registration and trial system, an essential feature for the SaaS, after several rounds of debugging frontend display issues, particularly with  and .

2.  **AI Agent:** Debug backend API for results.
3.  **AI Estimation Tool:** Resolve HTTP 500 errors and ensure robust, non-crashing estimations with high precision.
4.  **Dashboard:** Refactor for real-time luxury fashion news (Instagram, NewsAPI, RSS feeds) with real photos, dynamic graphs, and clickable articles. Remove useless buttons.
5.  **Sales Page (Pricing Selezione):** Create a professional pricing page with high-ticket full access and smaller subscriptions, correcting supplier count (22 premium suppliers).
6.  **Academy:** Expand to 20+ modules with real content, interactive quizzes, and progression tracking.
7.  **Product Sheet:** Optimize existing functionality.
8.  **New Mandatory Tools:** Integrated community chat, file management/order basket, margin calculator, member account system (paid registration, social auth, user info), product tracker, and five ultra-useful business tools (Barcode Scanner, AI Authenticator, Invoice Generator, Supplier CRM, Advanced Analytics).
9.  **Redundancy Removal:** Remove Analyseur du marché and Quiz expert from navigation.
10. **Backend APIs:** Utilize existing Chat GPT 4 Turbo API key.

**Subsequent Refinements/Corrections based on User Feedback:**
*   **Data Authenticity:** Crucially, replace all fictional data (Instagram, news, market figures, scanner) with real-time, professional API data (e.g., Meta Graph API for Instagram, News API, financial APIs for indices, UPC Database for scanner).
*   **Usability:** Make news articles clickable and useful (not just titles); ensure file hosting allows reading; add a purchase order/shopping cart system to file management.
*   **Menu Organization:** Reorganize navigation menu by themes (Business, Outils Pro, Gestion, Support, Compte) to resolve superposition and improve clarity.
*   **Dashboard Utility:** Make the dashboard genuinely useful with real data and relevant insights instead of static, useless information.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was tasked with implementing an inscription/trial system for new members. This involved creating new frontend components and modifying existing ones to manage user authentication and restrict access for trial users.

The work completed in this phase includes:
1.  **Creation of **: This new component handles user registration and login. It provides a professional interface with fields for name, email, password, and company, highlights a 14-day trial badge, and lists the benefits of the free trial (Dashboard access, 5 AI Estimations, Marketplace access, 10 product scans, unlimited CRM). It also includes a checkbox for terms and conditions.
2.  **Creation of **: This component is intended to display limitations for trial accounts and prompt users to upgrade to premium plans.
3.  **Modification of **: The main  file was updated to conditionally render either the main  (for authenticated/premium users) or the new  (for unauthenticated users), based on the user's authentication status, which is managed via . A duplicate  was also corrected during this process.
4.  **Modification of **: This critical layout component was updated to integrate the authentication flow. It now manages user state, handles logout functionality, and potentially limits access to certain features or displays the  based on the user's account type (trial, premium, enterprise). It also incorporates state management for the user menu and includes relevant imports for icons and components.

The current state is that a functional user registration and login system with a 14-day free trial is in place. The application correctly redirects unauthenticated users to the , and authenticated users (even trial ones) can access the main SaaS layout with appropriate feature limitations. The system is designed to allow new visitors to register, test limited features, and then easily upgrade. The last action was the user asking how to access the SaaS following the implementation of this authentication system.
