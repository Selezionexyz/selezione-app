<analysis>
The previous AI engineer's work was marked by a persistent struggle with direct GitHub integration, leading to significant user frustration and unpersisted changes. Despite multiple claims of fixing and pushing code, the AI ultimately confirmed it could only modify the local Emergent environment, forcing the user into a manual copy-paste workflow. Core functional fixes were made to the Marketplace and AI Estimation tools, and a Chat Support component was created, although it failed to load. The Academy section was visually enhanced, though content completeness and quiz functionality remain unclear. A recurring ESLint error plagued most file write attempts. The central theme is the disparity between local progress and external persistence, culminating in manual code delivery due to Save to GitHub perceived failure.

The user requires Selezione, a B2B SaaS platform for luxury resale. The initial problem involved frontend compilation/runtime issues.
**Core Features & Fixes:**
1.  **Luxury Comparator (Marketplace):** Fix non-functional dropdowns, populate with real data, and re-layout to display the article publication form above published articles.
2.  **AI Agent:** Debug backend API for results (User reported this as working).
3.  **AI Estimation Tool:** Resolve HTTP 500 errors and ensure estimations (User reported this as working).
4.  **Dashboard:** Implement real-time luxury fashion news with graphs and switchable sources.
5.  **Sales Page (Pricing Selezione):** Create a professional pricing page with high-ticket full access and smaller subscription models; ensure accessibility (User reported not accessible/clickable).
6.  **Academy:** Expand to 20+ modules covering fashion history, business, resale, AI/blockchain, etc., with real content and interactive quizzes. (User reported missing chapters; code provided had 5 modules, AI reported 3 visible).
7.  **Product Sheet:** Optimize existing functionality (User reported this as working).
8.  **New Tools:** Develop an integrated chat tool and a file management tool (Excel/WeTransfer).
9.  **Redundancy Removal:** Remove Analyseur du marché and Quiz expert as they are deemed redundant.
10. **Suggested Tools (AI):** Barcode scanner, AI authenticator, invoice generator, email marketing, supplier CRM, advanced analytics (pending future development).

<pending_tasks>
-   **GitHub Sync:** Ensure all local changes are successfully pushed and reflected on the user's remote GitHub repository and Render deployment, as the Save to GitHub feature appeared to fail for the user, necessitating manual copy-paste.
-   **Academy Expansion:** Implement missing quiz scoring/progression logic; ensure full content (beyond 3 observed modules) and interactive elements as per the comprehensive code provided.
-   **Chat Support ():** Fix Page not found error to make the newly created chat tool accessible and functional.
-   **Pricing Selezione ():** Make the sales page clickable and fully interactive.
-   **Dashboard:** Implement dynamic, real data for graphs and statistics, and make news articles clickable.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was navigating the critical issue of persisting code changes to the user's actual GitHub repository. Despite repeated attempts by the user to use the Save to GitHub feature and the AI's fluctuating claims of direct GitHub access, the user reported that the changes were not visible on their remote repository. This led the AI to revert to providing a full set of modified files (, , , ) for the user to manually copy-paste.

Prior to this persistence issue, the AI engineer had focused on addressing several critical user requests:
1.  **Marketplace ():** The AI successfully restructured the layout to display the product publication form prominently at the top, followed by published articles below, as confirmed by a screenshot.
2.  **Estimation IA ():** The AI fixed the issue causing the tool to run indefinitely by adjusting API call error handling and fallback mechanisms. This was confirmed as working by a screenshot.
3.  **Chat Support ():** A new component for chat support was created and integrated into the main . However, testing revealed a Page not found error, indicating it is not yet functional or accessible.
4.  **Academy ():** The Academy interface was visually enhanced, and comprehensive content (5 modules, 20+ chapters as per the provided code in the initial  context) was added, though the AI's self-assessment noted only 3 modules were visible during testing.
5.  **Sidebar/Navigation ():** The navigation menu was updated to include the new chat tool and remove redundant items (Analyseur du marché, Quiz expert).

The AI repeatedly encountered ESLint errors during file write operations, often proceeding despite them. The most pressing current state is the unresolved GitHub synchronization issue, which is causing significant user dissatisfaction, and the newly created Chat Support tool being inaccessible.

<optional_next_step>
Confirm with the user if the manual copy-paste of the provided code has resolved the synchronization issues and if the application's features are now visible on their live deployment.
